#### [Repurposed Structures v3.1.0 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3419684)

(V.3.1.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Mod Compat:

Fixed using the wrong path for importing End Remastered's loot into RS's structures chests.

Strongholds:

Added End Strongholds! Super rare and only spawns on within islands beyond 8000 blocks of the center of the End Dimension! You better bring your Elytra as the entrance is actually not on the surface but underside! But beware! It is very dangerous and massive to explore! And it also seems... off somehow... Can you figure out what is strange about it?

Bastions:

Buffed Underground Bastion loot a bit more and added "bonus_roll" to more of their loot tables. If you have increased Luck attribute (usually from another mod), you may find increased loot in Underground Bastion's chests.

Wandering Traders will now have a rare chance to sell a map to an Underground Bastion.

Dungeons:

In End Dungeons, Shulker Boxes now won't try and spawn on top of Shulker Boxes or turn the below Shulker Box into a Pig Spawner.

Shripwrecks:

Crimson, Warped, and Nether Bricks Shipwreck's spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them significantly more common. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Shipwreck config file or edit the rates yourself to be 27 or 29.

Ruins:

Made the default config value for Hot Land Ruins and Warm Land Ruins higher so those ruins are a bit more rare. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Ruins config file or edit the rates yourself to be 42 or 45.

Mansions:

If RS Mansions are turned off in the spawnrate configs, they will remove their map trades from Cartographers.

Fortresses:

If Jungle Fortresses are turned off in the spawnrate configs, they will remove their map trades from Cartographers.

Increased maximum config value allowed for Jungle Fortresses size up to 30.

Fixed vertical range config for Jungle Fortresses not actually applying when changed.

Mineshafts:

Increased maximum config value allowed for RS Mineshaft size up to 30.

(V.3.0.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Pyramids:

Restrict y range for the Bubble Column processor so that Ocean Pyramids do not crash if it tries to spawn below y = 0 or above y = 255.

(V.3.0.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Optimization:

Optimized many RS structures so they check their piece's bounding boxes more efficiently at generation! Some people reported having lag spikes once in a while when a RS Mineshaft spawns. This should reduce that significantly.

Lang:

Russian translation added by DrHesperus! Thank you!

Dungeons:

Fixed double chests only having loot for 1 chest instead of 2 in RS Dunegons.

Bastions:

Fixed Skeletons in Underground Bastions so they spawn with correct amount of health.

Adjusted bottom of Unit Rooms in Underground Bastions to be a bit less ugly in center.

Strongholds:

Fixed prison trapped Wither Skeletons in Nether Strongholds so they spawn with more health now.

Mineshafts:

Fixed Ocean Mineshaft center room sometimes have random Prismarine placed awkwardly.

Config:

Simplified and finalized the default configs for what structure spawns in lotr mod's dimension. No RS Structure with mobs will now spawn in that dimension. The modified entries will be automatically added to your current entries the first time you launch v3.0.3 RS.

Fixed spawnrate, min y, and max y configs not working for Mineshafts.

Fixed spawnrate, min y, and max y configs not working for Nether Strongholds.

Fixed spawnrate, min y, and max y configs not working for Jungle Fortresses.

Misc:

Fix potential issue where the structure check code may not work for preventing two specific structures from spawning on top of each other.

(V.3.0.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Villages:

Increased the default separation config value for RS's Overworld Villages to make them less cluttered in the world

RS Overworld Villages centers will not spawn within 6 chunks of Vanilla Villages or Outposts
